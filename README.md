## Getting Started

### Usage

* Choose your medication from the list of prescribed medication.
* Choose the quantity of medication you need based on duration.

### Improvements

Moving forward, I will improve the project by adding a requirement for the user to perform user authentication prior to accessing his/her prescription.
